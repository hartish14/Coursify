    <h3><B>Summary of Introduction to DSA</B></h3>
    <p>Guys, we are going to start data structures and algorithms with notes from today's video. This course will be primarily for placement preparations, so I will cover all the topics keeping in mind the placement, and I will make this course according to which you get maximum benefit.</p>

       <p> I will use C and C++ here, and even if you don't know C++, you will still be able to do this course without any issue. You should know that much of C, and even if you don't go into the depth of object orientation, it will still work.
        
        I will make available all of the notes in their pdf in the description below and I will tell you guys what is data structures and algorithms. Data structures are the ingredients for developing efficient algorithms, what is it?</p>
        
        <p>There are ingredients for developing efficient algorithms that are used to arrange data in main memory for efficient usage. We will learn about arrays, linked list, stack, queue, graphs, binary search trees, etc in this course, and I will teach in a very different way because I consider this a responsibility when you are teaching data structures and algorithms.
        
        Algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a given problem. To make tea, you pour water, add tea leaves, add sugar when it boils, add milk to it, and when it is ready, you sieve it and your hot tea is ready.</p>
        
        <p>This is an algorithm in the same way when any work is taken from the computer Who got the job done here? it is taken from human similarly, when work will be taken from computer then I'll speak to it in it's language.
        
        If you want to learn data structures &amp; algorithms through python, you should know C and C++ by default, and if you know java, you can follow this course very comfortably, but I will write the algorithms in C &amp; C++.
        
        If you are a beginner, learn C, it will not take much time, if you fall into the trap of learning it through python, you will be harmed, but you can program algorithms in python as well.</p>
        
        <p>We talked about data structures, we talked about algorithms, let's take an example of an algorithm in computer science language, I have given an example of making tea, which is right as per understanding will be felt a little peculiar.
        
        This course is going to be primarily for placements or if you want to switch the job or want to give interviews, so I will cover the content first and then I will tell you a lot about interviews in later videos.</p>
        
        <p>There are few terminologies, I would like to talk about them "database" and along with that, "data warehouse" and one is "big data" So let's understand database, data warehouse and big data here we have understood the data structure that when your program starts in RAM.
        
        Chrome will load into the RAM quickly and perform various tasks, including opening new tabs and downloading files.</p>
        
        <p>The people who have made the software of Chrome are responsible for making it optimal, which means to minimize the usage of RAM. This is done by making very efficient use of data structures, which are how to load a program into the main memory and do operations on data.
        
        The story in the database is kind of same, but here you retrieve and read the data from hard disk drive and update it. The data warehouse is a collection of information in permanent storage for faster retrieval and updation.
        
        You have understood the database, which is a huge amount of data stored in your hard disk drive. To keep the data for longer time, you have to use a database and learn the theory of databases, which is out of this course.</p>
        
        <p>Data warehouse means storing data separately from the main system, for example, the data from facebook.com, which will be used later to do analysis.
        
        I don't want to keep 2009's data in the same database as 2020 and 2021 because it will slow down my main system.
        
        Let's assume that facebook interacts with a database, and that the fresh data is kept in the database, and the legacy data is kept separate so that the legacy data can be analyzed later.
        
        Data warehousing is the process of storing legacy data efficiently, and big data is the process of creating an algorithm that can deal with a huge database that a normal algorithm or normal application may not be able to deal with.</p>
        
        <p>The definition of memory layout in C program is very important because it is used inside the industry and because all these things are used within the industry, if you know the definition of memory layout in C program then you will be given a good preference in comparison to other candidates.
        
        C programming gives you a good picture of memory and data structures and algorithms is best learned from C and C++. The first thing that happens when you open a program is that it gets loaded into the main memory.
        
        After this, look carefully at the 2 sections that I am going to draw, stack and heap, because it is very important to understand stacks and heaps if you really want to understand how the C program works.</p>
        
        <p>The main() function will be called first, and its activation record will be created. The activation record of main() has been created, and the activation record of fun1() has been created, and the activation record of fun1() has what is happening inside it?
        
        fun2() is calling inside fun1() and initializing k and l, then calling fun2() and fetching the value, then calling fun1() and getting the value.
        
        If fun2() has created a lot of variables, and inserted values in all of them, and finally returned a value whose value is 3, and I'm inserting it in a value named "k", what will happen when I do k = fun2()?
        
        So this function will give "3" to it, and then finally it will return some value, and then this entire space will get emptied when the program gets finished.</p>
        
        <p>When you don't have your own money, you go to the bank or request somebody that bro, give me 10 Rs, give me 20 Rs. You take the money for 10 days or for 20 days and then after arranging your own, you have returned it back.
        
        Let's take the example of phone, you request your friend's phone and he gives it back after playing PUBG, so you requested the phone and returned it and emptied the unused part.
        
        With the help of a pointer, we can request dynamic memory in C and C++. Let's say we want an array storing 4 integers, so we can point this pointer to malloc 4 * size of int and request it in dynamic memory.</p>
        
        <p>I can make it in stack as well, and release it whenever I want, so you can request this memory whenever you want, release it whenever you want. You can use the heap memory of your RAM by using a pointer from stack, and the heap will give you the address of the first element. You can use the heap memory however much you need, and release the pointer when you're done.
        
        Memory has to be used very efficiently, so we use heap and stack, and we run our algorithm in very less time. The next topic that we have is this time and space complexity, but I hope you have understood this.
        
        As the functions are getting called, a new stack is being created, and the execution of the functions will keep resuming as long as the stack is filled with values.</p>
        
        <p>You have to use the heap responsibly, if you made a mistake while using the heap then you can cause memory leak by using a lot of memory, therefore, whenever you are using heap, you have to allocate dynamic memory very carefully.
        
        If you are going for an interview and you don't know C, C++ or Java, you will be taken lightly over there even if you know data structures and algorithms. I recommend C and C++ if you are preparing data structures and algorithms for any product based company.
        
        If you don't know C properly, I have made a 15 hours long video of C with notes, so do access it and do like this video. I will see you next time.</p>
